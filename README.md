# Project-Instantaneous-Phase-Estimator

The goal of this project is to estimate the phase quickly and causally. See <a href="https://github.com/UriEdenLab/Project-Instantaneous-Phase-Estimator/wiki/Overview-and-Goals">wiki</a> for more detailed descriptions.

The file *particle_filter_phase_tracker.m* is the "Eden method". It uses the example data *sample_data.mat*.
